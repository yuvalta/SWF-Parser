function Param = maximization(Data, Param)
%{ 
This function calculates the second step of the EM algorithm, Maximization.
It updates the parameters of the Normal distributions according to the new 
labled dataset.
Input: 
    Data : nx3 (number of data points , [x, y, label])
    Param: (mu, sigma, lambda)
Output: 
    Param: updated parameters

Param.mu1 = [mean(points_in_cluster1(:,1)), mean(points_in_cluster1(:,2))];
