# SWF Parser

Currently works on The NASA Ames iPSC/860 log + MATLAB log

## How it works

Created a class called ```RowClass``` which has the following attributes:

- ```order```
- ```submit_time```
- ```wait_time```
- ```runtime```
- ```number_of_nodes ```
- ```average_cpu_time ```
- ```average_memory_per_node```
- ```requested_processors```
- ```requested_runtime```
- ```requested_memory ```
- ```status```
- ```user_id ```
- ```group_id ```
- ```application_id```
- ```number_of_queues ```
- ```number_of_partitions```
- ```preceding_job_number```
- ```think_time ```
- ```datetime ```

Each field is same as the SWF fields from the book (pg.73)

>1. Job number: a counter field, starting from 1.
>2. Submit time in seconds, relative to the start of the log.
>3. Wait time in the queue in seconds.
>4. Runtime (wallclock) in seconds. “Wait time” and “runtime” are used instead of the equivalent “start time” and “end time” because they are directly attributable to the scheduler and application, and are also suitable for models where only the runtime is relevant.
>5. Number of allocated processors.
>6. Average CPU time used per processor, both user and system, in seconds.
>7. Average memory used per node in kilobytes.
>8. Requested number of processors.
>9. Requested runtime (or CPU time).
>10. Requested memory (again kilobytes per processor).
>11. Status: 1 if the job was completed, 0 if it failed, and 5 if canceled.
>12. User ID: a number, between 1 and the number of different users.
>13. Group ID: a number, between 1 and the number of different groups.
>14. Executable (application): a number, between 1 and the number of different appli- cations appearing in the log.
>15. Queue: a number, between 1 and the number of different queues in the system.
>16. Partition: a number, between 1 and the number of different partitions in the sys- tem.
>17. Preceding job number, used in case this job depends on the termination of a pre- vious job.
>18. Think time from preceding job.
